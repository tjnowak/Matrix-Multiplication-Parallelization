# MatrixMultiplicationParallelization
Algorithms that increase the speed of matrix multiplication using parallel programming

## Summary
As part of a group project in college,  I attempted to increase the performance of matrix multiplication using parallel programming techniques. First, I created a serial implementation of the [Strassen matrix multiplication algorithm](https://iq.opengenus.org/strassens-matrix-multiplication-algorithm/) in C++. I then created several C++ parallel implementations of Strassen's method with the [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) and [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) parallel programming libraries. Finally, I ran all implementations on a university supercomputer and compared runtimes.
